# mooc-java-programming-ii
My solutions to the University of Helsinki's Java Programming course (v. 2020) and its exercises. I will regularly update this repository as I progress through the class. 

**PLEASE NOTE! With guidance from others, I have decided to skip some of the exercises in Part 14 related to JavaFX because the technology is outdated. As of 2021, Java has many other tools for rendering things on the front-end that are better than JavaFX. More importantly, Java is primarily used as a back-end technology rather than a front-end, which is why I have decided it wouldn't be worth my time to dig deeper into FX.
