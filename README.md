# mooc-java-programming-ii
My solutions to the University of Helsinki's Advanced Java Programming course (v. 2020) and its exercises. Please note that Parts 1-7 are part of the first course, Introduction to Java Programming, which are not included here.

**PLEASE NOTE! With guidance from others, I have decided to skip some of the exercises in Part 14 related to JavaFX because the technology is outdated. As of 2021, Java has many other tools for rendering things on the front-end that are better than JavaFX. More importantly, Java is primarily used as a back-end technology rather than a front-end, which is why I have decided it wouldn't be worth my time to dig deeper into FX.
